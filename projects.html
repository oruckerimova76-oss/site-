                    Description: This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and a responsive layout.
                    It includes multiple pages such as Home, About, and Projects. I designed and developed the entire structure,
                    and applied responsive design principles using CSS.

                    Description: For this project, we will work in a team of four students to organize an Hour of Code (Hour of AI) event. We will choose a team leader and communicate with instructors if any issues arise. General questions will be asked on Blackboard.

Our team will select a community, agree on a date and time, and get permission for photo and video recording. We will register the event using the team leader’s ADA email. The session will be taught using Microsoft MakeCode, and all team members will participate. We will record the event, give certificates to participants, and upload a recap video to YouTube with the required hashtags.
